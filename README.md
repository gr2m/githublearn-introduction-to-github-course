_Welcome to "Introduction to GitHub"! :wave:_

**What is GitHub?**: GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses [Git](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#git) for versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to [open-source](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#open-source) software.
<br>:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)

**What is a repository?**: A [repository](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#repository) is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.
<br>:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)

**What is a branch?**: A [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#branch) is a parallel version of your repository. You can make edits in your branch without impacting the `main` version. Branches allow us to separate our work from the `main` branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.
<br>:tv: [Video: Branches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQmu81G1yY)

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Navigate to the **Code** tab.
1. Click **Branch: main** in the drop-down.
1. In the field, enter a name for your branch: `my-first-branch`.
1. Click **Create branch: my-first-branch** or press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to create your branch.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<!-- 
  <<< Author notes: Step 2 >>>
  Start this step by acknowledging the previous step.
  Define terms and link to docs.github.com.

<details id=2>
<summary><h2>:pencil: Step 2: Commit a file</h2></summary>

_You created a branch! :tada:_

Creating a branch allows you to edit to your project without changing the `main` branch. Now that you have a branch, it’s time to create a file and make your first commit!

**What is a commit?**: A [commit](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit

The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub.

1. Create a new file on this branch called `PROFILE.md`.
   - Make sure you are on the "Code" tab.
   - In the branch drop-down, select `my-first-branch`.
   - Click **Create new file**.
   - In the "file name" field, type `PROFILE.md`.
1. When you’re done naming the file, add the following content to your file:
   ```md
   Welcome to my GitHub profile!
   ```
1. After adding the text, you can commit the change by entering a brief commit message `Add PROFILE.md` in the text-entry field below the file edit view.
1. After you’ve entered a commit message, click **Commit new file**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<!-- 
  <<< Author notes: Step 3 >>> 
  Just a historic note: the previous version of this step forced the learner
  to write a pull request description,
  checked that `main` was the receiving branch,
  and that the file was named correctly.
-->

<details id=3 open>
<summary><h2>:raised_hands: Step 3: Open a pull request</h2></summary>

_Nice work making that commit :sparkles:_

Now that you’ve created a commit, it’s time to share your proposed change through a pull request!

**What is a pull request?**: Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people. This pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the `main` branch.
<br>:tv: [Video: Introduction to pull requests](https://youtu.be/kJr-PIfLDl4)

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request

1. Open a pull request:
   - From the "Pull requests" tab, click **New pull request**.
   - In the "base:" drop-down menu, make sure the "main" branch is selected.
   - In the "compare:" drop-down menu, select `my-first-branch`.
1. When you’ve selected your branch, enter a title for your pull request: `Add my first file`.
1. The next field helps you provide a description of the changes you made. Feel free to add a description of what you’ve accomplished so far. As a reminder, you have: created a branch, created a file and made a commit, and opened a pull request.
1. Click **Create pull request**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

</details>

<!-- 
  <<< Author notes: Step 4 >>> 
  Just a historic note: The previous version of this step required responding
  to a pull request review before merging. The previous version also handled
  if users accidentally closed without merging.
-->

<details id=4>
<summary><h2>:chipmunk: Step 4: Merge your pull request</h2></summary>

_Nicely done friend! :sunglasses:_

You successfully created a pull request. You can now merge your pull request.

**What is a _merge_**: A [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the `main` branch.
<br>:tv: [Video: Understanding the GitHub flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBI2Rz-ZOxU)

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge the pull request

1. Click **Merge pull request**.
1. Click **Confirm merge**.
1. Once your branch has been merged, you don't need it anymore and you may click **Delete branch**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.
